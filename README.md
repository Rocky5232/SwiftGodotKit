SwiftGodotKit provides a way of embedding Godot into an existing Swift
application and driving Godot from Swift, without having to use an
extension.   This is a companion to [SwiftGodot](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot), which
provides the API binding to the Godot API.

# New SwiftGodotKit

This branch contains the new embeddable system that is better suited
to be embedded into an existing iOS and Mac app, and allows either a
full game to be displayed, or individual parts in an app.  This is
based on the new 4.4-based `libgodot` patches that turn Godot into an
embeddable library.

If you are looking for the old version that only ran on macOS, check
out the `legacy` branch.

## Sample Code

### MacOS Sample Code

This module contains a `TrivialSample` example code that shows both
how to embed a Godot-packaged game (PCK files), as well as how to embed
Godot UI elements are created programmatically.  This sample runs on macOS.

### iOS Sample Code

For iOS, you need a proper container; you can look at the peer
[`SwiftGodotKitSamples`](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKitSamples) 
project which hosts this library and a sample, and deploys to iOS devices (there 
is no support for the iOS simulator, as Godot does not run on those).

## Using this

Just reference this module from your Package.swift file or from Xcode.

## Sample

A simple SwiftUI API is provided.

In the example below, in an existing iOS project type using SwiftUI,
add a Godot PCK file to your project, and then call it like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftGodot
import SwiftGodotKit

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var app = GodotApp(packFile: "game.pck")

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Game is below:")
            GodotAppView()
                .padding()
        }
	.environment(\.godotApp, app)
    }
}
```

There can only be one GodotApp in your application, but you can reference different scenes from it.

# Sausage Making Details 

Check out SwiftGodotKit and `libgodot` as peers as well as a version
of Godot suitable to be used as a library:

```
git clone git@github.com:migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot
git clone git@github.com:migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit
git clone git@github.com:migueldeicaza/libgodot
```

For LibGodot, you want to use the libgodot_44_stable branch
Compile libgodot, this sample shows how I do this myself, but
you can pass the flags that make sense for your scenarios:


```
cd libgodot
scons target=template_debug dev_build=yes library_type=shared_library debug_symbols=yes 
```

The above will produce the binary that you want, then create an
xcframework out of it, using the script in SwiftGodot (a peer to this
repository):

```
cd ../SwiftGodot/scripts
sh -x make-libgodot.xcframework ../../SwiftGodot ../../libgodot /tmp/
```

Then you can reference that version of the libgodot.xcframework
